Error handling is crucial in network programming.
Rust’s Result type is extensively used for handling potential errors that might occur during network operations. 
Always handle the Result type properly to ensure robust applications. 
Understanding the asynchronous nature of network programming is vital. 
Rust’s async programming model, combined with libraries like tokio, provides an efficient way to handle concurrent network operations. 
This results in faster and more responsive applications.
